# Health Care Analysis with POWER BI
In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. In this Power BI Case study, you’ll explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat. You’ll analyze attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. I have used my DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations. To finish off, we bring it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights for the HealthStat team.
